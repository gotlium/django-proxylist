Checking proxies
----------------

Proxy checking is the core of `django-proxylist-for-grab`, in order to make it you need
three things:

* A checker: It shots a request throught the proxy.
* A proxy: Of course ...
* A mirror: It's a special page that reflects the checker request and allow us
  to see how an third page would see us.
